# random_toy_notebooks

A collection of toy notebooks for teaching my daughter python or relaxing.

- An [answer](notebooks/estimate_pi.ipynb) to a fun little interview question I saw on Reddit about estimating Pi given a certain function.
- A backtracking [Sudoku](notebooks/sudoku_solver.ipynb) solver with lazy evaluation using generators.
- A long [list](notebooks/coding_challenges.ipynb) of coding challenges that I do on my iPad on the couch to relax.
- A [notebook](notebooks/google_trends_stl_loess.ipynb) to answer if people are drinking more or less in COVID times.
